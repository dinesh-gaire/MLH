    Please structure the lesson plan clearly with the following sections using Markdown formatting:

    ## Lesson Plan: [Your Suggested Lesson Title]

    ### 1. Learning Objectives
    * [List 3-5 clear, measurable learning objectives (e.g., "Students will be able to explain...", "Students will be able to identify...")]

    ### 2. Materials and Resources
    * [List all necessary materials, e.g., whiteboard, markers, handouts, projector, specific websites/videos, physical objects]

    ### 3. Introduction (Engage) - [Suggested Time: X min]
    * [Brief activity or discussion to hook students and activate prior knowledge]

    ### 4. Direct Instruction (Explore/Explain) - [Suggested Time: X min]
    * [Core content delivery, key concepts, explanations]

    ### 5. Guided Practice (Elaborate) - [Suggested Time: X min]
    * [Activities where students practice with teacher support, e.g., group work, guided exercises]

    ### 6. Independent Practice (Evaluate) - [Suggested Time: X min]
    * [Activities where students apply knowledge independently, e.g., worksheets, short assignments]

    ### 7. Assessment
    * [How student understanding will be checked (formative/summative, e.g., quick quiz, observation, exit ticket, project rubric)]

    ### 8. Differentiation Strategies
    * [Ideas for supporting struggling learners and challenging advanced learners]

    ### 9. Homework/Extension Activities (Optional)
    * [Suggestions for follow-up work or deeper exploration]

    Ensure the suggested times for each section add up approximately to the total lesson duration.
